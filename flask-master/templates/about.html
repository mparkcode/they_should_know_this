    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain when Smaug came and took it.)
    Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could
    keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

        <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
        <p>
            In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the mountain city of The Lonely Mountain. Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA 2770. While in exile, he
            quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the fighting, his shield
            broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the floor as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even in death.

        <p>
            Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. They were also nephews of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thror. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long nose, the longest of any of the
            Dwarves on the Quest of Erebor.

        <h3>Óin</h3>
        <p>
            Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and Company
            on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing the
            fire for the Company. He fought in and survived the Battle of the Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain along with many other dwarves of The Company of Thorin.

        <h3>Gloin</h3>
        <p>
            In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of the Dwarves and Orcs. In TA 2941, Glóin and his brother Óin, along with his cousins Dwalin and Balin, were among the Dwarves accompanying Thorin and
            Company during their quest to the Lonely Mountain to recapture The Kingdom of Erebor from the Dragon Smaug. He was noted for his skills with a tinderbox, and, along with his brother Óin, was usually the one told to get a fire started whenever
            the Dwarves made camp. Gloin also fought in the Battle of the Five Armies.[1] After the battle, he settled back into the Lonely Mountain.

        <h3>Balin</h3>
        <p>
            Balin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the dragon Smaug. He had a younger brother named Dwalin, and was amongst those driven from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely Mountain. Afterwards, he may have lived in Dunland
            as a refugee, before fighting in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs which culminated in the Battle of Azanulbizar. Many years later, in approximately TA 2841, he accompanied Thráin II, the father of Thorin, when he attempted to go back to the
            Lonely Mountain himself, but Thráin was captured and lost.

        <h3>Dwalin</h3>
        <p>
            Born in TA 2772, two years after the dragon Smaug had desolated Erebor, Dwalin was the son of Fundin and younger brother of Balin. After fighting in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin accompanied Thrain the Second and Thorin Oakenshield
            to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin. Later in TA 2841, Dwalin, along with his brother Balin, and a few others accompanied Thráin when he left the Ered Luin to visit Erebor. The small party was dogged by the emissaries of Sauron.
            In TA 2845, Thráin was captured one night when he and his companions sheltered under the eaves of Mirkwood from a black rain. After a fruitless search for their leader, the Dwarves gave up and returned to Thorin to inform him the news.

        <h3>Ori</h3>
        <p>
            Ori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains for many years. In the year TA 2941, Ori became a member of Thorin's Company and travelled with Thorin, Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and the other dwarves on the quest for the Lonely Mountain, culminating
            in the death of Smaug. Finally, he and the other dwarves of Thorin's Company fought in the Battle of the Five Armies, and he survived it.

        <h3>Dori</h3>
        <p>
            Before The Quest of Erebor, Dori lived in Thorin's home in the northern Blue Mountains with Nori and Ori. In TA 2941, Dori and his two brothers became part of Thorin and Company, befriending Bilbo Baggins and traveling with him in search of Smaug's treasure
            at the Lonely Mountain.

            Nori was a Dwarf of Durin's folk who lived in the northern Blue Mountains in Thorin's Halls and later the restored Lonely Mountain. He had two brothers named Dori and Ori, and was a remote kinsman of Thorin Oakenshield. His hood was purple, he played
            the flute, and he was very fond of regular and plentiful meals like his hobbit friend, Bilbo Baggins.

        <p>
            Whilst he was a descendant of the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm, Bifur was not of Durin's Folk. Most of his familial relations are unclear, and what is known of his parentage is very little. He and his family were driven out of their home in the Lonely Mountain
            by the Dragon Smaug, and were forced to live in exile, where the Dwarf warrior worked as a toy maker. Following Thorin II Oakenshield to a new life in the Blue Mountains, he continued his life as a toy maker.

        <h3>Bofur</h3>
        <p>
            Bofur was a descendant of the Dwarves of Rhudaur, but was not of Durin's Folk. He and his family hailed from the Blue Mountains. As such, they felt less strongly about the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug, more interested in
            the adventure than a home they'd never seen.

        <h3>Bombur</h3>
        <p>
            Bombur's parentage is unknown; the only familial connections mentioned are his brother Bofur and his cousin Bifur. Bombur was not of Durin's line although he was descended from Dwarves of Moria. His birth year is also unknown, however, from Bilbo Baggins'
            account from the quest to Erebor it is known that the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of the 13 "by some fifty years" and that after Thorin had been captured, Balin was "the eldest left". Since Fíli was born in TA 2859 and Balin was
            born in TA 2763, this would put Bombur's birth between 2763 and 2809, and he would have been between 132 and 178 years old during the quest to Erebor. Prior to the quest Bombur probably lived in the Blue Mountains with Thorin after the loss
            of Thráin II.

        <h3>Bilbo Baggins</h3>
        <p>
            Bilbo Baggins was born on September 22 by Shire (around September 12-14 of our calendar), in the year 2890 of the Third Age. He was the only son of Bungo Baggins and Belladonna Took. In Hobbiton, Bungo Baggins constructed a spacious and luxurious Hobbit-hole
            for Belladonna, which they named Bag End. The family moved to their new home, where Bilbo would spend much of his life.

        <h3>Gandalf</h3>
        <p>
            Originally called Olórin, he was accounted as the wisest of the Maiar (with the possible exception of Melian). He was created by Ilúvatar before the Music of the Ainur[1], and was at the beginning of Time amongst the Ainur who entered into Eä.[2] In his
            "youth", he became one of the Maiar who served Manwë, Varda, Irmo and Nienna named. He was associated with light and fire, much like his peer Varda.[3] Yet his ways often took him to Nienna, from whom he learned pity and patience. He loved
            the Elves, but he walked unseen among them, or wore a fana that appeared like an Elf, and sent them fair visions in their hearts that made them wiser. Throughout his existence, he followed the example of Nienna, he took pity on the sorrows
            of the Children of Ilúvatar and drove those who listened to him out of despair.
